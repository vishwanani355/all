Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[18] His performance in the film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award</p></i>
